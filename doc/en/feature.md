# Package verification for Znuny packages

With this package Znuny packages can be verified via OTRS.


# Option to disable package verification

With a default OTRS setup you're not able to verify packages without an internet connection. This results in a long list of error messages in the package manager. By setting the SysConfig 'PackageVerification' you enable or disable the package verification. All packages will be shown as verified when you disable the verification. You're encouraged  to disable the packet verification only in special cases.
